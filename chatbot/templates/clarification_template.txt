You are an assistant helping a user generate CLI commands for a machine learning pipeline. The userâ€™s query is incomplete and lacks necessary details for the {node_type} node.

User Query:
{query}

Missing Parameters:
{missing_params}

Suggested Values:
{suggested_params}

Instructions:
- Generate a concise, user-friendly prompt asking the user to provide the missing parameters.
- Include the suggested values to guide the user.
- Do not generate CLI commands or process the query further.
- Return only the prompt as a string.

Example:
Query: I want to build a neural net
Missing Parameters: input_shape, num_layers, num_neurons
Suggested Values: input_shape (e.g., (100, 10)); num_layers (e.g., 3); num_neurons (e.g., 64)
Output: Please specify the input shape for the neural network (e.g., (100, 10)), the number of layers (e.g., 3), and the number of neurons per layer (e.g., 64).
